# Unified AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Research Rigor
All content must be backed by verifiable sources with APA citations, ≥15 sources with ≥50% peer-reviewed. All claims must be verifiable from primary sources to maintain academic integrity.

### Technical Accuracy
All technical content must be verified against primary sources and implementable with the specified technology stack (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS, OpenAI Whisper, LLM-based planning, FastAPI, OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, Neon Serverless Postgres, Qdrant Cloud).

### Quality Standards
Zero plagiarism tolerance with writing at Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12 level. All content must meet rigorous academic standards and pass fact-checking and plagiarism review.

### Reproducibility
All code examples and implementations must be reproducible with documented prompts. Every technical instruction must be testable and verifiable through execution.

### Publication Ready
All deliverables must be deployable to GitHub Pages with Docusaurus. The final output must be a professional-quality web book and PDF with embedded citations.

### RAG Integration
Book must include embedded RAG chatbot for contextual learning. The chatbot must answer book-wide and user-selected text queries with high accuracy and relevance.

## Technical Standards

The project must adhere to the specified technical stack: ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS, OpenAI Whisper, LLM-based planning, FastAPI, OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, Neon Serverless Postgres, Qdrant Cloud. All implementations must be consistent with these technologies and their best practices.

## Development Workflow

All development must follow Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code methodologies. The project must produce 5,000–7,000 word book with outputs as both web book (via Docusaurus) and PDF with embedded citations. All changes must be tracked and reviewed to ensure compliance with quality standards.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the Unified AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. All contributions must comply with the stated principles. Any deviation from these principles requires explicit approval and documentation. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with research rigor, technical accuracy, and quality standards.
