# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Research Module

## Overview
This module introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, demonstrating how large language models integrate with robotic perception and action to create intelligent autonomous systems.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Understanding of natural language processing fundamentals

## Module Structure
The VLA module consists of 4 chapters:

1. **VLA Foundations**: Understanding the concept of Vision-Language-Action systems and embodied intelligence
2. **Voice-to-Action Interfaces**: Exploring speech recognition with OpenAI Whisper and converting voice commands to robot intents
3. **Cognitive Planning with LLMs**: Translating natural language tasks into ROS 2 action sequences
4. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid**: Complete end-to-end VLA pipeline with navigation, object recognition, and manipulation

## Getting Started
1. Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the fundamental concepts of VLA systems
2. Progress through each chapter sequentially to build understanding
3. Complete the capstone project to see all components integrated

## Key Technologies
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive planning
- OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition
- ROS 2 for action sequences
- Simulation environments for demonstration

## Academic Standards
- All concepts are supported by peer-reviewed sources from the last 10 years
- APA citation style is used throughout
- Academic tone is maintained for educational rigor

## Navigation
- Use the sidebar to access individual chapters
- Follow the sequential order for optimal learning
- Refer to the references section for source materials
