**Feature**: 1-ai-robot-brain
**Created**: 2025-12-18

## Overview
This quickstart guide provides the essential information needed to begin developing the AI-Robot Brain Research Module covering NVIDIA Isaac tools for robotics education.

## Prerequisites
- Access to academic databases for peer-reviewed research
- Understanding of robotics fundamentals
- Familiarity with NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2)
- Knowledge of APA citation format
- Experience writing in academic tone

## Setup Environment
1. Ensure access to research databases (IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, etc.)
2. Install or access Docusaurus development environment
3. Set up a citation management tool (Zotero, Mendeley, or similar) for APA formatting
4. Prepare writing environment with Markdown support

## Research Phase
1. **Literature Review**:
   - Search for peer-reviewed papers on NVIDIA Isaac tools
   - Focus on papers about Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2
   - Gather sources on photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
   - Research VSLAM and sensor fusion implementations
   - Find academic papers on humanoid path planning

2. **Source Verification**:
   - Verify all sources are current (published within last 5-7 years for technical content)
   - Ensure at least 50% of sources are peer-reviewed
   - Confirm total of at least 15 sources across all chapters
   - Check for technical accuracy against official NVIDIA documentation

## Content Development
1. **Chapter Structure**:
   - Follow academic writing standards
   - Maintain consistent tone across all chapters
   - Include learning objectives for each chapter
   - Add key concepts with clear definitions
   - Integrate APA-formatted citations appropriately

2. **Writing Process**:
   - Start with Chapter 1 (foundational concepts)
   - Develop each chapter with 1000-2000 words
   - Ensure each chapter meets specific learning objectives
   - Include relevant examples and case studies
   - Cross-reference related concepts between chapters

## Quality Assurance
1. **Technical Review**:
   - Verify accuracy against NVIDIA Isaac documentation
   - Ensure technical concepts are explained clearly
   - Confirm alignment with current best practices

2. **Academic Review**:
   - Check for appropriate academic tone
   - Verify citation format and completeness
   - Ensure content meets target audience needs
   - Confirm adherence to Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12 level

## Integration with Docusaurus
1. **File Structure**:
   - Organize chapters in appropriate directory structure
   - Ensure proper navigation integration
   - Format content for Docusaurus Markdown requirements
   - Include proper frontmatter for each chapter

2. **Reference List**:
   - Create central APA reference list
   - Ensure all citations link properly to references
   - Verify formatting consistency

## Review and Approval Process
1. Conduct peer review of technical accuracy
2. Verify academic tone and quality standards
3. Check citation completeness and accuracy
4. Ensure all success criteria are met
5. Approve for publication to Docusaurus site

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Chapter 1 research and development
2. Follow the research plan outlined in research.md
3. Use the data model as a guide for content structure
4. Follow the implementation plan for systematic development
5. Conduct regular quality checks as outlined in the plan
