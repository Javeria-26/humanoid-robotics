**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for the AI-Robot Brain Research Module, resolving all previously identified needs for clarification.

## Resolved Decisions

### R1: Technical Depth for Overview Chapter
- **Decision**: Moderate technical depth with conceptual focus
- **Rationale**: Based on the target audience of robotics and AI students, the overview chapter will provide sufficient technical detail to understand concepts without overwhelming beginners. The focus will be on explaining the "why" and "what" rather than implementation details.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - High technical depth: Rejected as it might alienate students with less experience
  - Low technical depth: Rejected as it wouldn't meet the academic requirements
- **Source**: Inferred from target audience specification and academic tone requirement

### R2: Theoretical vs Practical Focus for Chapter 2
- **Decision**: Theoretical concepts with practical applications mentioned
- **Rationale**: The specification explicitly states "Not building: code" and requires an academic tone, indicating that theoretical understanding is prioritized over practical implementation details.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Practical implementation focus: Rejected as it contradicts the "Not building: code" constraint
  - Purely theoretical: Rejected as it might lack practical relevance for practitioners
- **Source**: Based on constraints in feature specification

### R3: VSLAM Algorithm Detail Level
- **Decision**: Conceptual explanation with key algorithmic principles
- **Rationale**: To maintain academic tone while providing sufficient technical understanding for the target audience. Focus on how hardware acceleration improves performance rather than mathematical details.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Mathematical detail: Rejected as too advanced for target audience
  - High-level overview only: Rejected as insufficiently technical for the audience
- **Source**: Inferred from target audience and academic tone requirements

### R4: Bipedal Movement Complexity Level
- **Decision**: Fundamental constraints and principles with examples
- **Rationale**: To make content accessible to students while providing practical insights for simulation practitioners. Focus on how bipedal constraints affect path planning rather than biomechanical details.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Biomechanical detail: Rejected as too specialized
  - Basic overview: Rejected as insufficient for technical audience
- **Source**: Inferred from target audience and academic requirements
