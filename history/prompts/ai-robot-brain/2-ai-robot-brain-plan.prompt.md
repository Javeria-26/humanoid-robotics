  Create: architecture sketch, section structure, research approach, quality validation.


  Project:

  Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)


  Format:

  Docusaurus book module (Markdown).


  Architecture:

  - Docusaurus documentation site

  - Module 3 as a standalone section

  - Chapters as individual pages

  - Central APA reference list


  Section structure:

  - Overview and objectives

  - Ch.1 AI-Robot Brain Overview

  - Ch.2 Perception & Training (Isaac Sim)

  - Ch.3 Localization & Navigation (Isaac ROS)

  - Ch.4 Humanoid Path Planning (Nav2)

  - Summary


  Research approach:

  - Research-concurrent writing

  - Peer-reviewed and authoritative technical sources

  - APA citation style


  Phases:

  - Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis


  Decisions to document:

  - Conceptual depth vs implementation detail

  - Emphasis on simulation vs deployment

  - Level of humanoid navigation complexity


  Testing strategy:

  - Evidence backing all claims

  - Alignment with learning objectives

  - Citation accuracy and completeness


  Quality validation:

  - Acceptance criteria checklist

  - Structural consistency and clarity review
response_text: |
  Created comprehensive implementation plan for AI-Robot Brain Research Module including:
  - Technical context with system architecture and dependencies
  - Constitution check ensuring compliance with project principles
  - Phase 0 research tasks with all clarifications resolved
  - Phase 1 design and contracts planning
