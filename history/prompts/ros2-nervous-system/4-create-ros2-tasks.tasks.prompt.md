# PHR: Create ROS 2 Tasks

## Prompt Text


## Response Text

Successfully generated comprehensive tasks for the ROS 2 educational module. Created tasks.md with 8 phases including Setup, Foundational, three user stories (P1-P3), Research and Citations, Quality Validation, and Polish phases. The tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and file paths. Each user story is organized to be independently implementable and testable, with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Outcome

The tasks document is complete with 69 specific tasks organized across 8 phases, following the project constitution requirements for research rigor, technical accuracy, and quality standards. Each task is specific enough to be executed independently with clear file paths and dependencies.

## Evaluation

The generated tasks successfully map to the user stories from the specification and align with the implementation plan architecture. All tasks follow the required checklist format and enable both sequential and parallel execution strategies.
