  Research Module: Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

  Target audience:
  Robotics and AI students; researchers in embodied AI.

  Module focus:
  Integration of large language models with robotic perception and action.

  Chapter structure (3–4 chapters):

  Chapter 1: Vision-Language-Action Foundations
  - Concept of VLA and embodied intelligence.
  - Role of LLMs in robotics decision-making.

  Chapter 2: Voice-to-Action Interfaces
  - Speech recognition using OpenAI Whisper.
  - Converting voice commands into structured robot intents.

  Chapter 3: Cognitive Planning with LLMs
  - Translating natural language tasks into ROS 2 action sequences.
  - Task decomposition and planning reliability.

  Chapter 4: Capstone – The Autonomous Humanoid
  - End-to-end VLA pipeline.
  - Navigation, object recognition, and manipulation in simulation.

  Success criteria:
  - Clear explanation of VLA concepts.
  - Ability to describe voice, planning, and action integration.
  - Claims supported by academic and technical sources.

  Constraints:
  - Markdown format, academic tone.
  - Peer-reviewed and authoritative sources (last 10 years).

  Not building:
  - Ethics discussion.
  - Product/vendor comparisons.
  - Code or implementation guides.
