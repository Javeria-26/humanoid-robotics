  Generated comprehensive task list for Digital Twin Simulation module with 60 tasks organized across 7 phases:

  - Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks) - Docusaurus structure and navigation
  - Phase 2: Foundational (6 tasks) - Research and templates
  - Phase 3: US1 Digital Twin Fundamentals (8 tasks) - Core concepts
  - Phase 4: US2 Gazebo Physics (9 tasks) - Physics simulation content
  - Phase 5: US3 Unity High-Fidelity (9 tasks) - Visualization content
  - Phase 6: US4 Sensor Simulation (10 tasks) - Sensor content
  - Phase 7: Polish (12 tasks) - Cross-cutting concerns

  All tasks follow required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and file paths. Each user story is independently testable with clear acceptance criteria.
outcome: |
  Complete task breakdown ready for implementation with proper dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and independent test criteria for each user story.
evaluation: |
  All tasks follow the required checklist format, user stories are properly prioritized and organized, and the implementation approach supports incremental delivery with MVP scope of US1.
