Reproducible code and documented prompts

Zero plagiarism tolerance

Constraints:

Word count: 5,000–7,000

Outputs: Web book + PDF with embedded citations

Success Criteria:

Public deployment

Fully functional context-aware RAG chatbot

Passes fact-checking and plagiarism review

## Response Text

Successfully updated the project constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific content for the "Unified AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" project. Created version 1.0.0 with 6 core principles aligned with project standards: Research Rigor, Technical Accuracy, Quality Standards, Reproducibility, Publication Ready, and RAG Integration. Also added Technical Standards, Development Workflow, and Governance sections reflecting the project requirements.

## Outcome

The constitution file has been successfully created and populated with project-specific principles and guidelines that align with the vision of creating a unified AI-native book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics with embedded RAG chatbot functionality.

## Evaluation

The constitution meets all requirements specified in the user input, with clear principles that enforce the academic rigor, technical accuracy, and quality standards required for the project.
