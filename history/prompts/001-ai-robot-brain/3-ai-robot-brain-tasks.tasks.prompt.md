# $ARGUMENTS

## Response Summary

Generated comprehensive task list for the AI-Robot Brain module implementation with:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - 4 tasks for Docusaurus project initialization
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** - 4 tasks for establishing content structure
3. **Phase 3: [US1] Overview Content** - 6 tasks for foundational chapter
4. **Phase 4: [US2] Perception & Training** - 5 tasks for Isaac Sim content
5. **Phase 5: [US3] Localization & Navigation** - 5 tasks for Isaac ROS content
6. **Phase 6: [US4] Humanoid Path Planning** - 5 tasks for Nav2 content
7. **Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting** - 8 tasks for final integration and validation

Total of 37 tasks organized by user story priority with clear file paths, dependencies, and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Outcome

Tasks are ready for implementation phase with each user story forming an independently testable increment. MVP scope defined as User Story 1 (AI-Robot Brain Overview) that delivers foundational value to students. All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.
