# Create: architecture sketch, section structure, research approach, quality validation.

## Project:
Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Format:
Docusaurus book module (Markdown).

## Architecture:
- Docusaurus documentation site
- Module 3 as a standalone section
- Chapters as individual pages
- Central APA reference list

## Section structure:
- Overview and objectives
- Ch.1 AI-Robot Brain Overview
- Ch.2 Perception & Training (Isaac Sim)
- Ch.3 Localization & Navigation (Isaac ROS)
- Ch.4 Humanoid Path Planning (Nav2)
- Summary

## Research approach:
- Research-concurrent writing
- Peer-reviewed and authoritative technical sources
- APA citation style

## Phases:
- Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis

## Decisions to document:
- Conceptual depth vs implementation detail
- Emphasis on simulation vs deployment
- Level of humanoid navigation complexity

## Testing strategy:
- Evidence backing all claims
- Alignment with learning objectives
- Citation accuracy and completeness

## Quality validation:
- Acceptance criteria checklist
- Structural consistency and clarity review

## Response Summary

Completed comprehensive planning for the AI-Robot Brain module including:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md) with:
   - Technical context for Docusaurus-based documentation
   - Project structure for the educational module
   - Constitution check (no constitution file found)

2. Research Document (research.md) with:
   - Foundational knowledge about NVIDIA Isaac tools
   - Key decisions on conceptual depth vs implementation
   - Academic sources in APA format

3. Data Model (data-model.md) with:
   - Educational content structure definition
   - Chapter specifications and learning objectives
   - Validation rules and relationships

4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md) with:
   - Setup instructions for contributors
   - Development workflow guidelines
   - Quality validation checklist

## Outcome

Planning phase complete with all required artifacts created. Ready to proceed to task generation phase (/sp.tasks) for implementation of the educational module.
