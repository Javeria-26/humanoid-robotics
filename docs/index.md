# ROS 2 Educational Module: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the educational module on ROS 2 as the "Robotic Nervous System". This module is designed for robotics and CS students with basic Python knowledge who want to understand how ROS 2 works as middleware to connect AI agents with humanoid robot control systems.

## About This Module

This educational resource provides a comprehensive introduction to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), focusing on its role as the "nervous system" of robotic systems. The module is structured into three main chapters that build upon each other:

1. **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/ros2-fundamentals)** - Learn about nodes, topics, services, and message flow
2. **[Python-ROS Bridge](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/python-ros-bridge)** - Understand how to use Python agents with rclpy
3. **[URDF for Humanoids](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/urdf-humanoids)** - Explore modeling links, joints, and robot structure

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 and its role as a robotic nervous system
- Use Python and the rclpy library to interact with ROS 2
- Understand and work with URDF for humanoid robot models
- Connect AI agents with humanoid robot control systems

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- Robotics students with basic Python knowledge
- Computer Science students interested in robotics
- Developers looking to understand ROS 2 architecture
- Anyone interested in the connection between AI and robotics

## Getting Started

Begin with the [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/ros2-fundamentals) chapter and progress through each section sequentially for the best learning experience.
