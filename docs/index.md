# ROS 2 Educational Modules: The Complete Robotics Curriculum

Welcome to the comprehensive educational modules covering ROS 2, Digital Twin Simulation, and AI-Robot Brains. This curriculum is designed for robotics and CS students with basic Python knowledge who want to understand the complete pipeline from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced AI-powered robotics.

## About This Curriculum

This educational resource provides a comprehensive introduction to three key areas of modern robotics:

### Module 1: ROS 2 as the Robotic Nervous System
- **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/ros2-fundamentals)** - Learn about nodes, topics, services, and message flow
- **[Python-ROS Bridge](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/python-ros-bridge)** - Understand how to use Python agents with rclpy
- **[URDF for Humanoids](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/urdf-humanoids)** - Explore modeling links, joints, and robot structure

### Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation
- **[Digital Twins in Robotics](./module-2/digital-twins-robotics)** - Understanding virtual replicas for robotics
- **[Physics Simulation](./module-2/physics-simulation)** - Creating realistic physics environments
- **[High-Fidelity Environments](./module-2/high-fidelity-env)** - Building detailed simulation worlds
- **[Sensor Simulation](./module-2/sensor-simulation)** - Simulating various robot sensors

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- **[Overview and Perception](./ai-robot-brain/chapter-1-overview)** - Introduction to AI-powered robot brains
- **[Perception Systems](./ai-robot-brain/chapter-2-perception)** - Understanding sensors and data processing
- **[Navigation](./ai-robot-brain/chapter-3-navigation)** - Path planning and movement
- **[Path Planning](./ai-robot-brain/chapter-4-path-planning)** - Advanced navigation algorithms

## Learning Objectives

After completing this curriculum, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 and its role as a robotic nervous system
- Create and work with digital twin simulations for robotics
- Implement AI-powered perception and navigation systems
- Connect AI agents with humanoid robot control systems
- Understand the complete pipeline from simulation to real-world robotics

## Target Audience

This curriculum is designed for:
- Robotics students with basic Python knowledge
- Computer Science students interested in robotics
- Developers looking to understand ROS 2, simulation, and AI
- Anyone interested in the connection between AI and robotics

## Getting Started

You can begin with any of the three modules, but we recommend starting with **[Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/index)** to build a strong foundation.
