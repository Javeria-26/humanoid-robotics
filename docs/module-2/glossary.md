# Glossary of Terms

## A

**Academic Tone**: Formal writing style appropriate for educational content, using objective language and evidence-based claims.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual replica of a physical robotic system that enables simulation, testing, and optimization before real-world deployment.

## E

**Environment Modeling**: The process of creating virtual representations of physical spaces where robots operate, including terrain, objects, and physical properties.

## G

**Gazebo**: A physics-based simulation environment that provides accurate modeling of robotic systems in complex environments, with support for gravity, forces, and collision detection.

## H

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study and implementation of interactions between humans and robots, including interface design and collaborative behaviors.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A sensor that measures specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, used to calculate position and orientation.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances and create 3D representations of the environment.

## P

**Physics Simulation**: Computer modeling of physical systems using mathematical equations to simulate real-world physics behaviors such as gravity, forces, and collisions.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

## S

**Sensor Simulation**: The process of creating realistic virtual sensor data that mimics the behavior and limitations of physical sensors in various environments.

## U

**Unity**: A real-time 3D development platform used for creating high-fidelity visualizations and interactive experiences, particularly valuable for creating photorealistic simulation environments.
