## Glossary of Terms

**Embodied Intelligence**: Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment, where cognitive processes are grounded in sensorimotor experiences and environmental interactions.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Advanced artificial intelligence models trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like language, often used for cognitive planning in robotics.

**Navigation Component**: The system component responsible for path planning, obstacle avoidance, and movement control in robotic systems.

**Object Recognition Component**: The system component that identifies, classifies, and localizes objects in the environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

**Manipulation Component**: The system component that controls robotic arms, grippers, and other end-effectors to interact with objects in the environment.

**Prompt Engineering**: The practice of designing and refining input prompts to guide large language models to generate desired outputs, particularly for robotic task planning.

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robotic software, providing hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, and message-passing functionality.

**Task Decomposition**: The process of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel.

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems**: Integrated robotic systems that combine visual perception, language understanding, and action execution in a unified framework.

**Voice-to-Action Interface**: A system that converts spoken language commands into structured robotic actions, typically involving speech recognition, natural language processing, and command structuring.

**Simulation Environment**: A virtual environment used to model, test, and validate robotic systems before deployment on physical robots, allowing for safe and efficient development.

**Cross-Modal Integration**: The process of combining information from different sensory modalities (vision, language, action) to improve system performance and understanding.

**Cognitive Planning**: The high-level decision-making process in robotic systems that interprets goals and generates action sequences to achieve desired outcomes.

**Language-Grounded Recognition**: Object recognition that incorporates natural language descriptions and semantic understanding to identify and locate objects.

**Human-Aware Navigation**: Navigation that considers human presence, social conventions, and collaborative behavior when planning robot paths.
