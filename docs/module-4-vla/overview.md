# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Research Module - Overview

## Module Introduction

This module introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, demonstrating how large language models integrate with robotic perception and action to create intelligent autonomous systems. The Vision-Language-Action paradigm represents a significant advancement in robotics, enabling machines to understand natural language commands, perceive their environment visually, and execute complex actions in response.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students and researchers will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental concepts of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems and embodied intelligence
2. Explain how speech recognition systems like OpenAI Whisper convert voice commands into structured robot intents
3. Describe the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in translating natural language tasks into ROS 2 action sequences
4. Analyze task decomposition and planning reliability concepts in VLA systems
5. Comprehend how navigation, object recognition, and manipulation components integrate in an end-to-end VLA pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Understanding of natural language processing fundamentals

## Module Structure

The VLA module consists of 4 chapters:

1. **VLA Foundations**: Understanding the concept of Vision-Language-Action systems and embodied intelligence
2. **Voice-to-Action Interfaces**: Exploring speech recognition with OpenAI Whisper and converting voice commands to robot intents
3. **Cognitive Planning with LLMs**: Translating natural language tasks into ROS 2 action sequences
4. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid**: Complete end-to-end VLA pipeline with navigation, object recognition, and manipulation

## Key Technologies
