# Academic Tone Guidelines

## Purpose

This document establishes the standards and practices for maintaining academic rigor and professional tone in all AI-Robot Brain educational content. These guidelines ensure consistency across all chapters and adherence to academic standards required by the specification.

## Core Principles

### 1. Formal Language
- Use third person perspective when possible
- Avoid contractions (use "do not" instead of "don't")
- Maintain objective, professional tone
- Avoid colloquialisms and informal expressions
- Use precise, technical terminology appropriate for the field

### 2. Evidence-Based Content
- Support all claims with peer-reviewed sources or authoritative technical documentation
- Attribute all non-original ideas, concepts, and data
- Clearly distinguish between established facts and theoretical concepts
- Include appropriate limitations and caveats for all technical assertions

### 3. Clarity and Precision
- Define technical terms upon first use
- Use consistent terminology throughout the module
- Structure content logically with clear topic sentences
- Ensure smooth transitions between concepts and sections

## Citation Standards

### APA Format Requirements
- Follow APA 7th edition format for all citations
- Include in-text citations for all referenced material
- Maintain consistency in citation style throughout
- Verify accuracy of all bibliographic information

### Source Quality
- Prioritize peer-reviewed journal articles
- Include conference papers from reputable venues
- Use official technical documentation from NVIDIA and other authoritative sources
- Avoid informal sources (blogs, forums, non-peer-reviewed articles) unless necessary

## Content Structure

### Learning Objectives
- Begin each section with clear, measurable learning objectives
- Use action verbs (explain, describe, analyze, apply)
- Ensure objectives align with content and assessments

### Key Concepts
- Highlight and define important terminology
- Provide clear explanations of complex concepts
- Use examples to illustrate abstract ideas
- Include visual aids where appropriate
