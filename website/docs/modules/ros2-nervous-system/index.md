# ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the educational module on ROS 2 as the "Robotic Nervous System". This module is designed for robotics and CS students with basic Python knowledge who want to understand how ROS 2 works as middleware to connect AI agents with humanoid robot control systems.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- The fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, and message flow)
- How to interact with ROS 2 using Python and the rclpy library
- How to understand and work with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoid robots

ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of a robot, coordinating communication between different components much like how the nervous system coordinates communication between different parts of the human body.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals) - Learn about nodes, topics, services, and message flow
2. [Python-ROS Bridge](./python-ros-bridge) - Understand how to use Python agents with rclpy
3. [URDF for Humanoids](./urdf-humanoids) - Explore modeling links, joints, and robot structure

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of how ROS 2 functions as the middleware connecting AI agents with robotic control systems.
